# Appointmet-planner

On codecademy I made an Appointment planner in react. With this planner you can make new contacts and Appointments.
In the Appointments section you can choose contacts you already filled in. The app doesn't contain any backend.
When the page will be refreshed all the data is lost.

## purpose

the purpose of this app was to learn about react and making a code review.

## points of improvement

The app is working but there are some point of improvement for the future.
I haven't found a way to remove the appointments or contacts.
when refreshing the page the data will be lost.
